  description: 'You''re sort of a book worm and you''ve read through the book list
    for the first-years. However, it''s always a good choice to have a nice read
    on the train. When you are about to open "Hogwarts: A history", there comes an
    arrogant boy who looks at you with an unpleasant look. "Eww, mud blood. Hogwarts
    needs to be more careful when giving admissions." He gruffs.'
  question: Confront him or not?
