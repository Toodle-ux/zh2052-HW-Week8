  description: Reading books is never your thing. You're soon attracted by the food
    truck with snacks that you've never seen before. When you're about to decide
    which snacks to buy, you're interrupted by a rude laugh. A boy is looking at
    you arrogantly. "Haven't you seen so many good stuff, mud blood?"
  question: Confront him or not?
