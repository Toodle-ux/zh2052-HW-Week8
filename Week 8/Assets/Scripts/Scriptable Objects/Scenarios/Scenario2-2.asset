  description: You've never been to nor heard of the existence of platform 9 and
    3/4. The only thing you can do is to follow other wizard-like students to run
    into the brick wall. Lucky enough, you get on the Hogwarts Express. Now, there's
    plenty of time on the way.
  question: Do you want to read some book to kill time?
