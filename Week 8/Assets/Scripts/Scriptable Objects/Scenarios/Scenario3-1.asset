  description: 'You''re sort of a book worm and you''ve read through the book list
    for the first-years. However, it''s always a good choice to have a nice read
    on the train. When you are about to open "Hogwarts: A history", there comes an
    arrogant boy who complaints that other cabins are full of mud blood. "Can I sit
    next to you? It seems the only clean place in these cabins." He says. '
  question: Do you want to make friend with him?
